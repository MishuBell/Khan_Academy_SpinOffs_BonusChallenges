## About  
This repository holds my **spin-offs** from the bonus challenges in Khan Academyâ€™s *Intro to Computer Science â€“ Python* course, created by Kim Merrill. These challenges appear after completing the main exercises in each unit.  

Iâ€™m tackling them one by one, following the iterative coding process: **Plan â†’ Write â†’ Execute â†’ Iterate** (as Khan Academy teaches). The goal? To sharpen my Python skills while keeping things **fun and lighthearted**.
